# Historical Cleanup Plan (Superseded)

> This file records the documentation cleanup proposal drafted before the 2025-11 restructure. The plan has already been executed.

## Current Guidance

- The completed work is summarized in [`docs/RESTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md`](RESTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md).
- Audience-oriented entry points now live under [`docs/guide/`](guide/).
- Legacy files moved during the cleanup are catalogued in [`docs/archive/README.md`](archive/README.md).

## Original Scope (for reference)

The proposal focused on:

1. Archiving redundant navigation files and German-language drafts.
2. Creating clear directories for findings, methodology, analysis, reference, and sessions.
3. Publishing a navigation hub at `docs/README.md` and updating the root `README.md` to match.

Those milestones are finished, so treat this document as historical context only. Future structural adjustments should be filed as new proposals linked from the research notebook guide.
